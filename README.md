### TODO
- [x] ESPNcricinfo live match data scrape
- [x] use a libreddit instance to scrape data. But hard to find the actual match thread..
- [ ] scraping the r/cricekt match thread is easier. But I am not yey sure if you can access the most importent ongoing live match from the `live match` section. For example currently (12th March) it first lists some Nepal domestic game and then Durham vs Zim A game. The later one being the more important and high value (relatively speaking). I will check back on 22nd March when the IPL begins to see if it shows KKR vs RCB first..
- [x] test the oled display via PIL library on PC
- [x] ESPNcricinfo or any other cricket site uses javascript for fetching live data. When on loop my function keeps returning the same data due to it. Need solution... Update : cricbuzz live while loop works fine. Gap 60s
- [x] Try integrating the date and time venue and toss status on top of the screen bar.
- [x] Well relying on multiple sites for the same match was bad. Gotta click the carousel box to get to the match..
- [ ] understand the OLED display code, i.e. `luma.core`, `luma.oled`
- [ ] seperate score and wicket from the string via regex
